# 🛍️ AIOutlet

**AIOutlet** is a reference, open-source e-commerce platform built with a modern, microservices-based architecture. It is designed to serve as a learning resource and architectural blueprint for developers, architects, and students exploring distributed systems, full-stack development, and cloud-native design.

## 🌐 Features

**AIOutlet** is a modern, modular, and AI-ready e-commerce platform — similar in ambition to Amazon — with support for both responsive web and native mobile applications. It is built from the ground up for flexibility, scalability, and extensibility, following these core principles:

- 🧱 **Microservices Architecture** — Each business capability is implemented as a separate microservice using the most suitable technology (Node.js, .NET, Python, Java, Go, etc.).
- 🖥️ **Frontend in React** — A sleek, responsive UI built with vanilla React, optimized for user experience.
- 📱 **Mobile-Ready** — Future support for native mobile apps using React Native or Flutter.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native** — Deployable locally with Docker Compose or to cloud platforms like Azure AKS using Kubernetes and Helm.
- 🧠 **AI-First Design** — Designed with AI/ML in mind: recommendation engine, intelligent chatbot, and NLP services are core to the vision.
- ⚙️ **DevOps with GitHub Actions** — Full CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions and reusable workflows across all microservices.
- 🗃️ **Polyglot Persistence** — Uses SQL, NoSQL, key-value, and graph databases — chosen based on the nature of each service's data.
- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization** — Supports secure login via email/password and OAuth2 (Google, Facebook, Twitter), JWT authentication, and role-based access control.
- 📡 **API-First & Event-Driven** — RESTful APIs and asynchronous communication using message queues for scalability and loose coupling.

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **🌐 Polyglot Architecture**: Each service uses the technology best suited for its requirements
- **🔄 Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via message queues and events
- **📊 Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Full activity tracking and compliance monitoring
- **🔒 Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security with OTP and account linking
- **⚡ High-Performance Services**: Go-based inventory service for speed-critical operations
- **🎯 Saga Pattern**: Distributed transaction management in order processing
- **📈 Scalable Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis for different data patterns
- **🛡️ Security-First Design**: JWT authentication, service-to-service tokens, and audit trails

## 🧩 Microservices Overview

Each microservice is hosted in its own GitHub repository for separation of concerns, independent scalability, and streamlined DevOps workflows. The platform demonstrates a polyglot architecture with different technologies chosen for each service's specific requirements:
