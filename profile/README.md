# 🛍️ AIOutlet

**AIOutlet** is a reference, open-source e-commerce platform built with a modern, microservices-based architecture. It is designed to serve as a learning resource and architectural blueprint for developers, architects, and students exploring distributed systems, full-stack development, and cloud-native design.

---

## 🌐 What is AIOutlet?

AIOutlet is a full-fledged, Amazon-like e-commerce platform with support for both web and native mobile apps. It is designed around the following principles:

- 🧱 **Microservices Architecture** — Each core domain is encapsulated in its own service, built using the best-suited technology (Node.js, .NET, Python, Java, Go, etc.).
- 🖥️ **Frontend in React** — A modern, responsive UI built using vanilla React.
- ☁️ **Cloud-Ready** — Run the entire system locally using Docker Compose, or deploy to the cloud using Kubernetes (AKS).
- 🧠 **AI-First Design** — Future-proof architecture with support for AI-driven features like recommendations, chatbot, and NLP.
- ⚙️ **DevOps with GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipelines are powered by GitHub Actions, fully integrated with GitHub repositories.
- 🗃️ **Polyglot Persistence** — Mix of SQL, NoSQL, key-value, and graph databases. The right tool for the right use case.
- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization** — Secure login via username/password or social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter), JWT-based authentication, and role-based access control.

## 🧩 Microservices Overview

Each microservice is hosted in its own GitHub repository for separation of concerns, independent scalability, and better DevOps workflows. Key services include:

- **auth-service**: Handles authentication, OAuth2, and JWT.
- **user-service**: Manages user profiles and data.
- **product-service**: Manages product catalog.
- **order-service**: Handles order placement and management.
- **payment-service**: Integrates with payment providers.
- **inventory-service**: Tracks stock and availability.
- **cart-service**: Manages user shopping carts.
- **review-service**: Manages product reviews and ratings.
- **recommendation-service** *(planned)*: Uses AI/ML to offer personalized product suggestions.

> 🔧 Each service uses the most appropriate tech stack and storage (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j).

## 📦 How to Use

You can run AIOutlet in three ways:

1. **Local Dev** — Use VS Code Workspaces to navigate and develop across all services.
2. **Docker** — Use Docker Compose to bring up all services locally.
3. **Kubernetes (AKS)** — Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service for production-grade infrastructure.
